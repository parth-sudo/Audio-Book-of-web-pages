A python mini project which allows you to scrap information from any website and then convert it into speech.
This way, you dont have to read all the stuff and you can listen to the info instead.
Pretty helpful when you have to read on sites like wikipedia, gfg etc.
Utilized Python's beautiful soup4 for scraping the info, Microsoft's Speech recogniton API for text to speech, and did some automation using selenium.

1. Open scrap.py file.
2. Change the website if you want in the code. (by default its wikipedia)
3. In the terminal, type this: python scrap.py Lionel Messi(for example)
4. This will complete the url's path to the webpage.
5. Hit enter.
